             <p>[[ whatever comes to mind ]]</p>
             <p>After my last organisation folded, I took it upon myself to broaden my horizons and learn some critical soft skills such as business development, sales, content creation, and marketing in order to broaden my horizons. Thus, I started an alternative universe/chinese alchemy fantasy art project with the aim to generate a stream of passive income and develop the habit of documentation of the process.</p>
